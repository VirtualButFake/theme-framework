## Features

ThemeFramework is made to be a simple and organized way to handle different themes in Fusion. Through reactive values, it can easily switch between different themes and update the UI accordingly.
It gives the user full control over all aspects of the theme through `AppearanceOverride`s, which can be passed to the color to override values, implementing this in a way that is seamless for the developer to work alongside.

By default, ThemeFramework supports three values within a color: `color`, `transparency` and `shadow`.
